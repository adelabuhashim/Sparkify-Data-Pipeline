# Sparkify-Data-Pipeline
Creating Data Pipeline using AIRFLOW


## Introduction
A music streaming company, Sparkify, has decided that it is time to introduce more automation and monitoring to their data warehouse ETL pipelines and come to the conclusion that the best tool to achieve this is Apache Airflow.

They have decided to bring you into the project and expect you to create high grade data pipelines that are dynamic and built from reusable tasks, can be monitored, and allow easy backfills. They have also noted that the data quality plays a big part when analyses are executed on top the data warehouse and want to run tests against their datasets after the ETL steps have been executed to catch any discrepancies in the datasets.

The source data resides in S3 and needs to be processed in Sparkify's data warehouse in Amazon Redshift. The source datasets consist of JSON logs that tell about user activity in the application and JSON metadata about the songs the users listen to.

## Project Datasets
- Two datasets that reside in S3:
    - Song data: ``s3://udacity-dend/song_data``        
    - Log data: ``s3://udacity-dend/log_data``

- Log data json path: ``s3://udacity-dend/log_json_path.json``

### Song Dataset
The first dataset is a subset of real data from  [the Million Song Dataset](http://millionsongdataset.com/). Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. For example, here are file paths to two files in this dataset.
```
song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json
song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json
```
And below is an example of what a single song file, TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json, looks like.

### Log Dataset
The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this [event simulator](https://github.com/Interana/eventsim) based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate app activity logs from an imaginary music streaming app based on configuration settings.

The log files in the dataset are partitioned by year and month. For example, here are file paths to two files in this dataset.
```
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json
```

And below is an example of what the data in a log file, 2018-11-12-events.json, looks like.

## Schema for Song Play Analysis

#### Fact Table
1. **songplays** - records in event data associated with song plays i.e. records with page ``NextSong``
        songplay_id, start_time, user_id, level, song_id, artist_id, session_id, location, user_agent
#### Dimension Tables
2. **users** - users in the app
        user_id, first_name, last_name, gender, level
3. **songs** - songs in music database
        song_id, title, artist_id, year, duration
4. **artists** - artists in music database
        artist_id, name, location, lattitude, longitude
5. **time** - timestamps of records in **songplays** broken down into specific units
     - start_time, hour, day, week, month, year, weekday

## Project Steps
1. Create IAM ROLE allowing Programmatic access.
2. Create Cluster on Redshift.
3. Setup hooks and connections on the airflow admin panel.

Be patient while making a pipeline, those errors may motivate you!
